# lmds 0.1.0

Initial release of lmds.
* Landmark Multi-Dimensional Scaling (LMDS) is an extension of classical 'Torgerson' MDS.
  LMDS scales to significantly larger data sets since it only computes the distances between
  a set of landmarks and all samples. Has built-in support for sparse matrices.
